# Predicting Sectoral Productivity Trends in New Zealand (1978–2023)

## Description
Productivity is a critical measure of economic performance, reflecting how efficiently resources are utilized to generate output. This project leverages the **Productivity Statistics: 1978–2023** dataset from Stats NZ to analyze and predict productivity trends across various economic sectors in New Zealand.

This dataset spans decades of productivity data, segmented by sector (e.g., "Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing") and resource type (e.g., "Capital," "Labor"). Our objective is to address key questions about sectoral performance and use machine learning models to forecast future productivity.

The dataset can be accessed directly [here](https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Productivity-statistics/Productivity-statistics-1978-2023/Download-data/productivity-statistics-1978-2023.csv) and was obtained from the [Stats NZ site](https://www.stats.govt.nz/large-datasets/csv-files-for-download/).
